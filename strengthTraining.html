                <p id="boxText">
                    Strength training or resistance training is any exercise design to improve your strength
                    and endurance. Bicep curls, bench press and push ups are all examples of strength training. 
                    The basic concept of strength training is to overload a group of muscles, typically by contracting 
                    the muscles under heavy resistance and returning to the start position for several repetitions until 
                    failure. This creates micro tears in the muscles which the body will heal and in the process increases 
                    the bulk and strength of the muscles.

                            A set is one complete round of repetitions of an exercise before a break is taken.  
                            Generally you should rest for at <a href="https://www.bodybuilding.com/content/how-long-should-you-rest-between-sets.html#:~:text=To%20increase%20strength%20and%20power,seconds%20or%20less%20between%20sets." target="_blank">
                            least a minute</a> before moving on to the next set. 
                            This allows time for you to regain your strength and is important so you don’t strain yourself 
                            too hard. Try to keep the repetitions consistent for every set.

                    When doing any weight training exercises it is important to avoid your chances of getting 
                    injured. Always learn about the correct posture and keep it throughout the exercise. If you're 
                    starting out. Try a few test runs of exercises to see how much you can repeat and at what 
                    weight before failure. Then set this as your number of repetitions. Of course you can’t just 
                    keep doing the same number of repetitions or stick to just one weight. You must apply
